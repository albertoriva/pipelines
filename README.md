# pipelines
Computational pipelines for bioinformatics

## Introduction
This package contains:
* An object-oriented library implementing commonly-used processing steps for bioinformatics pipelines;
* Accessory code and utilities to develop pipelines
* Several pipelines for bioinformatics applications (e.g. RNAseq, ChIPseq).

Documentation for the individual modules is coming soon.
